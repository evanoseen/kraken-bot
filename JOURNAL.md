# Iteration Journal

One entry per day. Capture: what shipped, what surprised, what's next.

## Day 1, 2026-05-19

**Shipped:** The daily iteration system itself. Created `DAILY_ITERATIONS.md` (30 curated tasks across docs, tests, refactors, observability, features, ops), `JOURNAL.md` (this file), and `scripts/daily.sh` (deterministic picker that prints today's task by day index). Updated `README.md` to surface the new workflow.

**Surprised by:** How much legitimate engineering work the bot was missing. Zero tests, zero docstrings on the API client, no kill switch, no project ISA, no runbook, no logging beyond `print()`. The 30 task backlog wrote itself once I cataloged the gaps.

**Next:** Day 2, seed a project `ISA.md` at the repo root with the twelve section structure from PAI doctrine.
